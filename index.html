							<h2>Background Story</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p>
								I started college as a PRE-MED biology major hoping to follow on my parents’ footsteps. Little did I know that life had different plans. One year down the line began my journey into the CS world, the first class was challenging but doable, so I thought to pursue it future, and to cut the long story short here I am working as a Software Engineer. 
							</p>
							<p>
								There are somethings I vividly remember from my experience the <b><i>Imposter Syndrome:</b></i> this is very real!!! Every time I didn’t get a concept in class or struggled to do my assignment I felt like I didn’t belong here. By Junior year most of my classmates had internships lined up and I had nothing, being on the shy side didn’t aid either I felt embarrassed and started questioning myself. Did I make the right choice? Do I even belong here? All I was looking for was someone to take a chance on me.
							</p>
							<p>
								Last year I was lucky enough that my manager gave me the opportunity to lead the interns project, I got the opportunity to help them navigate their internship. I can proudly say that all of them received return offers.
								I believe that collaborating with people to build a project is a great way to not only learn new tech but also learn about/experience the challenges that come along with working on a team. When it comes to work/life both skills are invaluable.
							</p>
							<p>
								This Summer I am hosting a remote Project <b><i>@InternProject</i></b> where I am looking to mentor 4-5 interns into completion of a summer project. 
								Key Takeaway:
								Learn how to work on an agile team, improve communication, time management skills, gain confidence in your work, most of all have fun owing a project.
